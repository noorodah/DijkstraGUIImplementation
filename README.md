# Dijkstra GUI Implementation
Dijkstra algorithm with gui graph implemented in python


Implementation for illusterating finding closest path using gui graph implemented using pyqt5 library in python

How to use :

You can insert a new node by clicking on the wide empty screen that shows up, once clicked an input window would pop up letting type the 
node name, notice that the code was implemented to hace single character as a node name,so you can only use one alpha char.


A tool box will appear when opening the program in it you'll find the option to add an edge between two nodes , delete an existing edge,
modify an existing edge, deleting a node, changing a node name.

And finally the generate closest path button, before you'd specify the source node and the target node, The app will delete all edges and 
keep only the closest path edges.

Notice that i'm a begginer at programming so the code won't probably be clean code, Neither a well explained code, Possible improvement in the future.

Things i look to do in the future :

1- Instead of deleting all non closest path edges highlighte the closest path edges.
2- Improve code and make it more clean and understandable.
3- Adding the option to choose more algorthims.

Notice to use it you'll need to have pyqt5 library imported in your python file, if you don't know how, simply in cmd type pip install pyqt5.
